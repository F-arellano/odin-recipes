    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup of vegetables</li>
        <li>bacon</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            over medium-high heat, sauté the vegetables and garlic in olive oil until soft, <br>
            about 3-5 minutes depending on the vegetables you choose. Set them aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            cooking the bacon, garlic and onion over medium heat until bacon <br>
            is cooked and onion is soft (5-8 minutes). Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Begin by whisking the eggs vigorously with salt and pepper until they are homogenous (uniform throughout). <br>
            This step is incredibly important, you want to beat those eggs until <br>
            there are no pieces of whites separated from the yolks. 
        </li>
        <li>
            melt the butter in an 8” nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. It’s very important that you use an 8″ pan. <br>
            If you use a larger pan the omelet will be too thin, a smaller pan will yield a very thick omelet.<br>
            Then, add the whisked eggs and swirl them in the pan until they are evenly distributed.
        </li>
        <li>
            cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat until the eggs begin to set. <br>
            Please don’t rush the process, low heat is important when cooking omelettes so they don’t overcook.  
        </li>
        <li>
            once they begin to set, use a spatula to gently push the edges in slightly and swirl the pan <br>
            so that any uncooked eggs on the top pour over the sides to the edges of the pan and cook.<br>
            Once the omelette is mostly set (about 5-6 minutes), carefully flip it and turn off the heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            sprinkle the cheese over the top of the omelette and add the toppings on one half of the omelette. 
        </li>
    </ol>
